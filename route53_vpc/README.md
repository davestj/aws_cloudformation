# CloudFormation Template: Route 53 Internal Hosted DNS Zone, VPC, Subnet, Security Group, DHCP Options Set, and KMS Key

This CloudFormation template creates a Route 53 internal hosted DNS zone, VPC, subnet, security group, DHCP options set, and a multi-region customer managed KMS key.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of AWS CloudFormation and networking concepts

## Deployment Steps

1. Open the AWS CloudFormation console.

2. Choose "Create Stack" and upload the CloudFormation template file.

3. Provide the required parameters such as HostedZoneName, VpcCidrBlock, SubnetCidrBlock, and KeyAlias.

4. Review the stack configuration and click "Create Stack".

5. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to be created. It may take a few minutes.

## Parameters

- **HostedZoneName**: The name for the internal hosted DNS zone.
- **VpcCidrBlock**: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: 10.0.0.0/16).
- **SubnetCidrBlock**: The CIDR block for the subnet (default: 10.0.0.0/24).
- **KeyAlias**: The alias for the new multi-region customer managed KMS key.

## Resources

- **HostedZone**: Creates a Route 53 internal hosted DNS zone with the specified name.
- **VPC**: Creates a VPC with the specified CIDR block and enables DNS support and hostnames.
- **Subnet**: Creates a subnet within the VPC with the specified CIDR block.
- **SecurityGroup**: Creates a security group allowing SSH and HTTPS access from anywhere.
- **DHCPOptions**: Creates DHCP options with the specified domain name and DNS servers.
- **DHCPOptionsAssociation**: Associates the DHCP options with the VPC.
- **KMSKey**: Creates a multi-region customer managed KMS key for encryption and decryption.
- **KMSKeyAlias**: Creates an alias for the KMS key using the specified alias name.

## Outputs

- **HostedZoneId**: The ID of the Route 53 internal hosted DNS zone.
- **VpcId**: The ID of the VPC.
- **SubnetId**: The ID of the subnet.
- **SecurityGroupId**: The ID of the security group.
- **KMSKeyId**: The ID of the KMS key.

## Security Considerations

- By default, the CloudFormation template opens port 22 and port 443 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) in the security group for demonstration purposes. Adjust the security group rules as per your security requirements.

## Cleanup

To delete the CloudFormation stack and associated resources:

1. Open the AWS CloudFormation console.

2. Select the stack created by this template.

3. Choose "Delete Stack" and confirm the deletion.

4. Wait for the stack to be deleted. It may take several minutes.
